## SUMMARY:
Please make sure you have completed the soot survey at:
    [soot.binghamton.edu](https://soot.binghamton.edu)

Please list the urls for the APIs you used:
https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/
https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films

https://x-math.herokuapp.com/
https://x-math.herokuapp.com/api/random

Summary of Program:
My program utilizes 2 different APIs. One includes a bank of simple math questions, and the other is a database with information on 22 different Studio Ghibli films. I created a class to pull data from each API and describe different methods for each. For the math API, I created a method to test the user and "tutor" them in math. For the Studio Ghibli API I created a method for the user to search for a film recommendation based on a keyword, and to try a random selection among the movies.

Most Challenging topic in the course:
I definitely found object-based programming and GUI programming the most challenging. Writing functions based on "self" is very abstract for me, since I have only had experience coding in R for statistics, so I never did any GUI programming. It was an awesome challenge though and I have learned a lot!
